## The Rules are simple

1. Each player picks a suit of cards
2. Draw a card, if the cardsuit matches your suit you gain a point
3. if all players have above 1 point, a bonus card is drawn which subtracts a point from the player whos cardsuits matches the newly drawn bonus card. The same happens for when all players have above 2, 3 and 4 points
4. the first person with 5 points win

This game can be used as a drinking game, where all the loseres drink the amount of points they were from 5 points

Alternatively the winner can give out 5 sips.

Good luck, and have fun!
